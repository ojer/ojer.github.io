|| NAME
||     ack - grep-like text finder
|| 
|| SYNOPSIS
||         ack [options] PATTERN [FILE...]
||         ack -f [options] [DIRECTORY...]
|| 
|| DESCRIPTION
||     ack is designed as an alternative to grep for programmers.
|| 
||     ack searches the named input FILEs or DIRECTORYs for lines containing a
||     match to the given PATTERN. By default, ack prints the matching lines.
||     If no FILE or DIRECTORY is given, the current directory will be
||     searched.
|| 
||     PATTERN is a Perl regular expression. Perl regular expressions are
||     commonly found in other programming languages, but for the particulars
||     of their behavior, please consult perlreref
||     <https://perldoc.perl.org/perlreref.html>. If you don't know how to use
||     regular expression but are interested in learning, you may consult
||     perlretut <https://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html>. If you do not need
||     or want ack to use regular expressions, please see the "-Q"/"--literal"
||     option.
|| 
||     Ack can also list files that would be searched, without actually
||     searching them, to let you take advantage of ack's file-type filtering
||     capabilities.
|| 
|| FILE SELECTION
||     If files are not specified for searching, either on the command line or
||     piped in with the "-x" option, ack delves into subdirectories selecting
||     files for searching.
|| 
||     ack is intelligent about the files it searches. It knows about certain
||     file types, based on both the extension on the file and, in some cases,
||     the contents of the file. These selections can be made with the --type
||     option.
|| 
||     With no file selection, ack searches through regular files that are not
||     explicitly excluded by --ignore-dir and --ignore-file options, either
||     present in ackrc files or on the command line.
|| 
||     The default options for ack ignore certain files and directories. These
||     include:
|| 
||     *   Backup files: Files matching #*# or ending with ~.
|| 
||     *   Coredumps: Files matching core.\d+
|| 
||     *   Version control directories like .svn and .git.
|| 
||     Run ack with the "--dump" option to see what settings are set.
|| 
||     However, ack always searches the files given on the command line, no
||     matter what type. If you tell ack to search in a coredump, it will
||     search in a coredump.
|| 
|| DIRECTORY SELECTION
||     ack descends through the directory tree of the starting directories
||     specified. If no directories are specified, the current working
||     directory is used. However, it will ignore the shadow directories used
||     by many version control systems, and the build directories used by the
||     Perl MakeMaker system. You may add or remove a directory from this list
||     with the --[no]ignore-dir option. The option may be repeated to
||     add/remove multiple directories from the ignore list.
|| 
||     For a complete list of directories that do not get searched, run "ack
||     --dump".
|| 
|| MATCHING IN A RANGE OF LINES
||     The "--range-start" and "--range-end" options let you specify ranges of
||     lines to search within each file.
|| 
||     Say you had the following file, called testfile:
|| 
||         # This function calls print on "foo".
||         sub foo {
||             print 'foo';
||         }
||         my $print = 1;
||         sub bar {
||             print 'bar';
||         }
||         my $task = 'print';
|| 
||     Calling "ack print" will give us five matches:
|| 
||         $ ack print testfile
||         # This function calls print on "foo".
||             print 'foo';
||         my $print = 1;
||             print 'bar';
||         my $task = 'print';
|| 
||     What if we only want to search for "print" within the subroutines? We
||     can specify ranges of lines that we want ack to search. The range starts
||     with any line that matches the pattern "^sub \w+", and stops with any
||     line that matches "^}".
|| 
||         $ ack --range-start='^sub \w+' --range-end='^}' print testfile
||             print 'foo';
||             print 'bar';
|| 
||     Note that ack searched two ranges of lines. The listing below shows
||     which lines were in a range and which were out of the range.
|| 
||         Out # This function calls print on "foo".
||         In  sub foo {
||         In      print 'foo';
||         In  }
||         Out my $print = 1;
||         In  sub bar {
||         In      print 'bar';
||         In  }
||         Out my $task = 'print';
|| 
||     You don't have to specify both "--range-start" and "--range-end". IF
||     "--range-start" is omitted, then the range runs from the first line in
||     the file unitl the first line that matches "--range-end". Similarly, if
||     "--range-end" is omitted, the range runs from the first line matching
||     "--range-start" to the end of the file.
|| 
||     For example, if you wanted to search all HTML files up until the first
||     instance of the "<body>", you could do
|| 
||         ack foo --range-end='<body>'
|| 
||     Or to search after Perl's `__DATA__` or `__END__` markers, you would do
|| 
||         ack pattern --range-end='^__(END|DATA)__'
|| 
||     It's possible for a range to start and stop on the same line. For
||     example
|| 
||         --range-start='<title>' --range-end='</title>'
|| 
||     would match this line as both the start and end of the range, making a
||     one-line range.
|| 
||         <title>Page title</title>
|| 
||     Note that the patterns in "--range-start" and "--range-end" are not
||     affected by options like "-i", "-w" and "-Q" that modify the behavior of
||     the main pattern being matched.
|| 
||     Again, ranges only affect where matches are looked for. Everything else
||     in ack works the same way. Using "-c" option with a range will give a
||     count of all the matches that appear within those ranges. The "-l" shows
||     those files that have a match within a range, and the "-L" option shows
||     files that do not have a match within a range.
|| 
||     The "-v" option for negating a match works inside the range, too. To see
||     lines that don't match "google" within the "<head>" section of your HTML
||     files, you could do:
|| 
||         ack google -v --html --range-start='<head' --range-end='</head>'
|| 
||     Specifying a range to search does not affect how matches are displayed.
||     The context for a match will still be the same, and
|| 
||     Using the context options work the same way, and will show context lines
||     for matches even if the context lines fall outside the range. Similarly,
||     "--passthru" will show all lines in the file, but only show matches for
||     lines within the range.
|| 
|| OPTIONS
||     --ackrc
||         Specifies an ackrc file to load after all others; see "ACKRC
||         LOCATION SEMANTICS".
|| 
||     -A NUM, --after-context=NUM
||         Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.
|| 
||     -B NUM, --before-context=NUM
||         Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.
|| 
||     --[no]break
||         Print a break between results from different files. On by default
||         when used interactively.
|| 
||     -C [NUM], --context[=NUM]
||         Print NUM lines (default 2) of context around matching lines. You
||         can specify zero lines of context to override another context
||         specified in an ackrc.
|| 
||     -c, --count
||         Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for
||         each input file. If -l is in effect, it will only show the number of
||         lines for each file that has lines matching. Without -l, some line
||         counts may be zeroes.
|| 
||         If combined with -h (--no-filename) ack outputs only one total
||         count.
|| 
||     --[no]color, --[no]colour
||         --color highlights the matching text. --nocolor suppresses the
||         color. This is on by default unless the output is redirected.
|| 
||         On Windows, this option is off by default unless the
||         Win32::Console::ANSI module is installed or the "ACK_PAGER_COLOR"
||         environment variable is used.
|| 
||     --color-filename=color
||         Sets the color to be used for filenames.
|| 
||     --color-match=color
||         Sets the color to be used for matches.
|| 
||     --color-colno=color
||         Sets the color to be used for column numbers.
|| 
||     --color-lineno=color
||         Sets the color to be used for line numbers.
|| 
||     --[no]column
||         Show the column number of the first match. This is helpful for
||         editors that can place your cursor at a given position.
|| 
||     --create-ackrc
||         Dumps the default ack options to standard output. This is useful for
||         when you want to customize the defaults.
|| 
||     --dump
||         Writes the list of options loaded and where they came from to
||         standard output. Handy for debugging.
|| 
||     --[no]env
||         --noenv disables all environment processing. No .ackrc is read and
||         all environment variables are ignored. By default, ack considers
||         .ackrc and settings in the environment.
|| 
||     --flush
||         --flush flushes output immediately. This is off by default unless
||         ack is running interactively (when output goes to a pipe or file).
|| 
||     -f  Only print the files that would be searched, without actually doing
||         any searching. PATTERN must not be specified, or it will be taken as
||         a path to search.
|| 
||     --files-from=FILE
||         The list of files to be searched is specified in FILE. The list of
||         files are separated by newlines. If FILE is "-", the list is loaded
||         from standard input.
|| 
||         Note that the list of files is not filtered in any way. If you add
||         "--type=html" in addition to "--files-from", the "--type" will be
||         ignored.
|| 
||     --[no]filter
||         Forces ack to act as if it were receiving input via a pipe.
|| 
||     --[no]follow
||         Follow or don't follow symlinks, other than whatever starting files
||         or directories were specified on the command line.
|| 
||         This is off by default.
|| 
||     -g PATTERN
||         Print searchable files where the relative path + filename matches
||         PATTERN.
|| 
||         Note that
|| 
||             ack -g foo
|| 
||         is exactly the same as
|| 
||             ack -f | ack foo
|| 
||         This means that just as ack will not search, for example, .jpg
||         files, "-g" will not list .jpg files either. ack is not intended to
||         be a general-purpose file finder.
|| 
||         Note also that if you have "-i" in your .ackrc that the filenames to
||         be matched will be case-insensitive as well.
|| 
||         This option can be combined with --color to make it easier to spot
||         the match.
|| 
||     --[no]group
||         --group groups matches by file name. This is the default when used
||         interactively.
|| 
||         --nogroup prints one result per line, like grep. This is the default
||         when output is redirected.
|| 
||     -H, --with-filename
||         Print the filename for each match. This is the default unless
||         searching a single explicitly specified file.
|| 
||     -h, --no-filename
||         Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files
||         are searched.
|| 
||     --[no]heading
||         Print a filename heading above each file's results. This is the
||         default when used interactively.
|| 
||     --help
||         Print a short help statement.
|| 
||     --help-types
||         Print all known types.
|| 
||     --help-colors
||         Print a chart of various color combinations.
|| 
||     --help-rgb-colors
||         Like --help-colors but with more precise RGB colors.
|| 
||     -i, --ignore-case
||         Ignore case distinctions in PATTERN. Overrides --smart-case and -I.
|| 
||     -I, --no-ignore-case
||         Turns on case distinctions in PATTERN. Overrides --smart-case and
||         -i.
|| 
||     --ignore-ack-defaults
||         Tells ack to completely ignore the default definitions provided with
||         ack. This is useful in combination with --create-ackrc if you really
||         want to customize ack.
|| 
||     --[no]ignore-dir=DIRNAME, --[no]ignore-directory=DIRNAME
||         Ignore directory (as CVS, .svn, etc are ignored). May be used
||         multiple times to ignore multiple directories. For example, mason
||         users may wish to include --ignore-dir=data. The --noignore-dir
||         option allows users to search directories which would normally be
||         ignored (perhaps to research the contents of .svn/props
||         directories).
|| 
||         The DIRNAME must always be a simple directory name. Nested
||         directories like foo/bar are NOT supported. You would need to
||         specify --ignore-dir=foo and then no files from any foo directory
||         are taken into account by ack unless given explicitly on the command
||         line.
|| 
||     --ignore-file=FILTER:ARGS
||         Ignore files matching FILTER:ARGS. The filters are specified
||         identically to file type filters as seen in "Defining your own
||         types".
|| 
||     -k, --known-types
||         Limit selected files to those with types that ack knows about.
|| 
||     -l, --files-with-matches
||         Only print the filenames of matching files, instead of the matching
||         text.
|| 
||     -L, --files-without-matches
||         Only print the filenames of files that do NOT match.
|| 
||     --match PATTERN
||         Specify the PATTERN explicitly. This is helpful if you don't want to
||         put the regex as your first argument, e.g. when executing multiple
||         searches over the same set of files.
|| 
||             # search for foo and bar in given files
||             ack file1 t/file* --match foo
||             ack file1 t/file* --match bar
|| 
||     -m=NUM, --max-count=NUM
||         Print only NUM matches out of each file. If you want to stop ack
||         after printing the first match of any kind, use the -1 options.
|| 
||     --man
||         Print this manual page.
|| 
||     -n, --no-recurse
||         No descending into subdirectories.
|| 
||     -o  Show only the part of each line matching PATTERN (turns off text
||         highlighting). This is exactly the same as "--output=$&".
|| 
||     --output=expr
||         Output the evaluation of expr for each line (turns off text
||         highlighting). If PATTERN matches more than once then a line is
||         output for each non-overlapping match.
|| 
||         expr may contain the strings "\n", "\r" and "\t", which will be
||         expanded to their corresponding characters line feed, carriage
||         return and tab, respectively.
|| 
||         expr may also contain the following Perl special variables:
|| 
||         $1 through $9
||             The subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing
||             parentheses. If your pattern is "(.+) and (.+)", and the string
||             is "this and that', then $1 is "this" and $2 is "that".
|| 
||         $_  The contents of the line in the file.
|| 
||         $.  The number of the line in the file.
|| 
||         $&, $` and $'
||             $& is the the string matched by the pattern, $` is what precedes
||             the match, and $' is what follows it. If the pattern is
||             "gra(ph|nd)" and the string is "lexicographic", then $& is
||             "graph", $` is "lexico" and $' is "ic".
|| 
||             Use of these variables in your output will slow down the pattern
||             matching.
|| 
||         $+  The match made by the last parentheses that matched in the
||             pattern. For example, if your pattern is "Version:
||             (.+)|Revision: (.+)", then $+ will contain whichever set of
||             parentheses matched.
|| 
||         $f  $f is available, in "--output" only, to insert the filename.
||             This is a stand-in for the discovered $filename usage in old
||             "ack2 --output", which is disallowed with "ack3" improved
||             security.
|| 
||             The intended usage is to provide the grep or compile-error
||             syntax needed for editor/IDE go-to-line integration, e.g.
||             "--output=$f:$.:$_" or "--output=$f\t$.\t$&"
|| 
||     --pager=program, --nopager
||         --pager directs ack's output through program. This can also be
||         specified via the "ACK_PAGER" and "ACK_PAGER_COLOR" environment
||         variables.
|| 
||         Using --pager does not suppress grouping and coloring like piping
||         output on the command-line does.
|| 
||         --nopager cancels any setting in ~/.ackrc, "ACK_PAGER" or
||         "ACK_PAGER_COLOR". No output will be sent through a pager.
|| 
||     --passthru
||         Prints all lines, whether or not they match the expression.
||         Highlighting will still work, though, so it can be used to highlight
||         matches while still seeing the entire file, as in:
|| 
||             # Watch a log file, and highlight a certain IP address.
||             $ tail -f ~/access.log | ack --passthru 123.45.67.89
|| 
||     --print0
||         Only works in conjunction with -f, -g, -l or -c, options that only
||         list filenames. The filenames are output separated with a null byte
||         instead of the usual newline. This is helpful when dealing with
||         filenames that contain whitespace, e.g.
|| 
||             # Remove all files of type HTML.
||             ack -f --html --print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
|| 
||     -p[N], --proximate[=N]
||         Groups together match lines that are within N lines of each other.
||         This is useful for visually picking out matches that appear close to
||         other matches.
|| 
||         For example, if you got these results without the "--proximate"
||         option,
|| 
||             15: First match
||             18: Second match
||             19: Third match
||             37: Fourth match
|| 
||         they would look like this with "--proximate=1"
|| 
||             15: First match
|| 
||             18: Second match
||             19: Third match
|| 
||             37: Fourth match
|| 
||         and this with "--proximate=3".
|| 
||             15: First match
||             18: Second match
||             19: Third match
|| 
||             37: Fourth match
|| 
||         If N is omitted, N is set to 1.
|| 
||     -P  Negates the effect of the --proximate option. Shortcut for
||         --proximate=0.
|| 
||     -Q, --literal
||         Quote all metacharacters in PATTERN, it is treated as a literal.
|| 
||     -r, -R, --recurse
||         Recurse into sub-directories. This is the default and just here for
||         compatibility with grep. You can also use it for turning
||         --no-recurse off.
|| 
||     --range-start=PATTERN, --range-end=PATTERN
||         Specifies patterns that mark the start and end of a range. See
||         "MATCHING IN A RANGE OF LINES" for details.
|| 
||     -s  Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files. This
||         is taken from fgrep.
|| 
||     -S, --[no]smart-case, --no-smart-case
||         Ignore case in the search strings if PATTERN contains no uppercase
||         characters. This is similar to "smartcase" in the vim text editor.
||         The options overrides -i and -I.
|| 
||         -S is a synonym for --smart-case.
|| 
||         -i always overrides this option.
|| 
||     --sort-files
||         Sorts the found files lexicographically. Use this if you want your
||         file listings to be deterministic between runs of ack.
|| 
||     --show-types
||         Outputs the filetypes that ack associates with each file.
|| 
||         Works with -f and -g options.
|| 
||     -t TYPE, --type=TYPE, --TYPE
||         Specify the types of files to include in the search. TYPE is a
||         filetype, like perl or xml. --type=perl can also be specified as
||         --perl, although this is deprecated.
|| 
||         Type inclusions can be repeated and are ORed together.

||         See ack --help-types for a list of valid types.
|| 
||     -T TYPE, --type=noTYPE, --noTYPE
||         Specifies the type of files to exclude from the search.
||         --type=noperl can be done as --noperl, although this is deprecated.
|| 
||         If a file is of both type "foo" and "bar", specifying both
||         --type=foo and --type=nobar will exclude the file, because an
||         exclusion takes precedence over an inclusion.
|| 
||     --type-add TYPE:FILTER:ARGS
||         Files with the given ARGS applied to the given FILTER are recognized
||         as being of (the existing) type TYPE. See also "Defining your own
||         types".
|| 
||     --type-set TYPE:FILTER:ARGS
||         Files with the given ARGS applied to the given FILTER are recognized
||         as being of type TYPE. This replaces an existing definition for type
||         TYPE. See also "Defining your own types".
|| 
||     --type-del TYPE
||         The filters associated with TYPE are removed from Ack, and are no
||         longer considered for searches.
|| 
||     --[no]underline
||         Turns on underlining of matches, where "underlining" is printing a
||         line of carets under the match.
|| 
||             $ ack -u foo
||             peanuts.txt
||             17: Come kick the football you fool
||                               ^^^          ^^^
||             623: Price per square foot
||                                   ^^^
|| 
||         This is useful if you're dumping the results of an ack run into a
||         text file or printer that doesn't support ANSI color codes.
|| 
||         The setting of underline does not affect highlighting of matches.
|| 
||     -v, --invert-match
||         Invert match: select non-matching lines.
|| 
||     --version
||         Display version and copyright information.
|| 
||     -w, --word-regexp
||         Force PATTERN to match only whole words.
|| 
||     -x  An abbreviation for --files-from=-. The list of files to search are
||         read from standard input, with one line per file.
|| 
||         Note that the list of files is not filtered in any way. If you add
||         "--type=html" in addition to "-x", the "--type" will be ignored.
|| 
||     -1  Stops after reporting first match of any kind. This is different
||         from --max-count=1 or -m1, where only one match per file is shown.
||         Also, -1 works with -f and -g, where -m does not.
|| 
||     --thpppt
||         Display the all-important Bill The Cat logo. Note that the exact
||         spelling of --thpppppt is not important. It's checked against a
||         regular expression.
|| 
||     --bar
||         Check with the admiral for traps.
|| 
||     --cathy
||         Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate!
|| 
|| THE .ackrc FILE
||     The .ackrc file contains command-line options that are prepended to the
||     command line before processing. Multiple options may live on multiple
||     lines. Lines beginning with a # are ignored. A .ackrc might look like
||     this:
|| 
||         # Always sort the files
||         --sort-files
|| 
||         # Always color, even if piping to another program
||         --color
|| 
||         # Use "less -r" as my pager
||         --pager=less -r
|| 
||     Note that arguments with spaces in them do not need to be quoted, as
||     they are not interpreted by the shell. Basically, each line in the
||     .ackrc file is interpreted as one element of @ARGV.
|| 
||     ack looks in several locations for .ackrc files; the searching process
||     is detailed in "ACKRC LOCATION SEMANTICS". These files are not
||     considered if --noenv is specified on the command line.
|| 
|| Defining your own types
||     ack allows you to define your own types in addition to the predefined
||     types. This is done with command line options that are best put into an
||     .ackrc file - then you do not have to define your types over and over
||     again. In the following examples the options will always be shown on one
||     command line so that they can be easily copy & pasted.
|| 
||     File types can be specified both with the the --type=xxx option, or the
||     file type as an option itself. For example, if you create a filetype of
||     "cobol", you can specify --type=cobol or simply --cobol. File types must
||     be at least two characters long. This is why the C language is --cc and
||     the R language is --rr.
|| 
||     ack --perl foo searches for foo in all perl files. ack --help-types
||     tells you, that perl files are files ending in .pl, .pm, .pod or .t. So
||     what if you would like to include .xs files as well when searching for
||     --perl files? ack --type-add perl:ext:xs --perl foo does this for you.
||     --type-add appends additional extensions to an existing type.
|| 
||     If you want to define a new type, or completely redefine an existing
||     type, then use --type-set. ack --type-set eiffel:ext:e,eiffel defines
||     the type eiffel to include files with the extensions .e or .eiffel. So
||     to search for all eiffel files containing the word Bertrand use ack
||     --type-set eiffel:ext:e,eiffel --eiffel Bertrand. As usual, you can also
||     write --type=eiffel instead of --eiffel. Negation also works, so
||     --noeiffel excludes all eiffel files from a search. Redefining also
||     works: ack --type-set cc:ext:c,h and .xs files no longer belong to the
||     type cc.
|| 
||     When defining your own types in the .ackrc file you have to use the
||     following:
|| 
||       --type-set=eiffel:ext:e,eiffel
|| 
||     or writing on separate lines
|| 
||       --type-set
||       eiffel:ext:e,eiffel
|| 
||     The following does NOT work in the .ackrc file:
|| 
||       --type-set eiffel:ext:e,eiffel
|| 
||     In order to see all currently defined types, use --help-types, e.g. ack
||     --type-set backup:ext:bak --type-add perl:ext:perl --help-types
|| 
||     In addition to filtering based on extension, ack offers additional
||     filter types. The generic syntax is --type-set TYPE:FILTER:ARGS; ARGS
||     depends on the value of FILTER.
|| 
||     is:FILENAME
||         is filters match the target filename exactly. It takes exactly one
||         argument, which is the name of the file to match.
|| 
||         Example:
|| 
||             --type-set make:is:Makefile
|| 
||     ext:EXTENSION[,EXTENSION2[,...]]
||         ext filters match the extension of the target file against a list of
||         extensions. No leading dot is needed for the extensions.
|| 
||         Example:
|| 
||             --type-set perl:ext:pl,pm,t
|| 
||     match:PATTERN
||         match filters match the target filename against a regular
||         expression. The regular expression is made case-insensitive for the
||         search.
|| 
||         Example:
|| 
||             --type-set make:match:/(gnu)?makefile/
|| 
||     firstlinematch:PATTERN
||         firstlinematch matches the first line of the target file against a
||         regular expression. Like match, the regular expression is made case
||         insensitive.
|| 
||         Example:
|| 
||             --type-add perl:firstlinematch:/perl/
|| 
|| ACK COLORS
||     ack allows customization of the colors it uses when presenting matches
||     onscreen. It uses the colors available in Perl's Term::ANSIColor module,
||     which provides the following listed values. Note that case does not
||     matter when using these values.
|| 
||     There are four different colors ack uses:
|| 
||         Aspect      Option              Env. variable       Default
||         --------    -----------------   ------------------  ---------------
||         filename    --color-filename    ACK_COLOR_FILENAME  black on_yellow
||         match       --color-match       ACK_COLOR_MATCH     bold green
||         line no.    --color-lineno      ACK COLOR_LINENO    bold yellow
||         column no.  --color-colno       ACK COLOR_COLNO     bold yellow
|| 
||     The column number column is only used if the column number is shown
||     because of the --column option.
|| 
||     Colors may be specified by command-line option, such as "ack
||     --color-filename='red on_white'", or by setting an environment variable,
||     such as "ACK_COLOR_FILENAME='red on_white'". Options for colors can be
||     set in your ACKRC file (See "THE .ackrc FILE").
|| 
||     ack can understand the following colors for the foreground:
|| 
||         black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white
|| 
||     The optional background color is specified by prepending "on_" to one of
||     the foreground colors:
|| 
||         on_black on_red on_green on_yellow on_blue on_magenta on_cyan on_white
|| 
||     Each of the foreground colors can be modified with the following
||     attributes, which may or may not be supported by your terminal:
|| 
||         bold faint italic underline blink reverse concealed
|| 
||     Any combinations of modifiers can be added to the foreground color. If
||     your terminal supports it, and you enjoy visual punishment, you can
||     specify:
|| 
||         ack --color-filename="blink italic underline bold red on_yellow"
|| 
||     For charts of the colors and what they look like, run "ack
||     --help-colors" and "ack --help-rgb-colors".
|| 
||     If the eight standard colors, in their bold, faint and unmodified
||     states, aren't enough for you to choose from, you can also specify
||     colors by their RGB values. They are specified as "rgbXYZ" where X, Y,
||     and Z are values between 0 and 5 giving the intensity of red, green and
||     blue, respectively. Therefore, "rgb500" is pure red, "rgb505" is purple,
||     and so on.
|| 
||     Background colors can be specified with the "on_" prefix prepended on an
||     RGB color, so that "on_rgb505" would be a purple background.
|| 
||     The modifier attributes of blink, italic, underscore and so on may or
||     may not work on the RGB colors.
|| 
||     For a chart of the 216 possible RGB colors, run "ack --help-rgb-colors".
|| 
|| ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
||     For commonly-used ack options, environment variables can make life much
||     easier. These variables are ignored if --noenv is specified on the
||     command line.
|| 
||     ACKRC
||         Specifies the location of the user's .ackrc file. If this file
||         doesn't exist, ack looks in the default location.
|| 
||     ACK_COLOR_COLNO
||         Color specification for the column number in ack's output. By
||         default, the column number is not shown. You have to enable it with
||         the --column option. See the section "ack Colors" above.
|| 
||     ACK_COLOR_FILENAME
||         Color specification for the filename in ack's output. See the
||         section "ack Colors" above.
|| 
||     ACK_COLOR_LINENO
||         Color specification for the line number in ack's output. See the
||         section "ack Colors" above.
|| 
||     ACK_COLOR_MATCH
||         Color specification for the matched text in ack's output. See the
||         section "ack Colors" above.
|| 
||     ACK_PAGER
||         Specifies a pager program, such as "more", "less" or "most", to
||         which ack will send its output.
|| 
||         Using "ACK_PAGER" does not suppress grouping and coloring like
||         piping output on the command-line does, except that on Windows ack
||         will assume that "ACK_PAGER" does not support color.
|| 
||         "ACK_PAGER_COLOR" overrides "ACK_PAGER" if both are specified.
|| 
||     ACK_PAGER_COLOR
||         Specifies a pager program that understands ANSI color sequences.
||         Using "ACK_PAGER_COLOR" does not suppress grouping and coloring like
||         piping output on the command-line does.
|| 
||         If you are not on Windows, you never need to use "ACK_PAGER_COLOR".
|| 
|| ACK & OTHER TOOLS
||   Simple vim integration
||     ack integrates easily with the Vim text editor. Set this in your .vimrc
||     to use ack instead of grep:
|| 
||         set grepprg=ack\ -k
|| 
||     That example uses "-k" to search through only files of the types ack
||     knows about, but you may use other default flags. Now you can search
||     with ack and easily step through the results in Vim:
|| 
||       :grep Dumper perllib
|| 
||   Editor integration
||     Many users have integrated ack into their preferred text editors. For
||     details and links, see <https://beyondgrep.com/more-tools/>.
|| 
||   Shell and Return Code
||     For greater compatibility with grep, ack in normal use returns shell
||     return or exit code of 0 only if something is found and 1 if no match is
||     found.
|| 
||     (Shell exit code 1 is "$?=256" in perl with "system" or backticks.)
|| 
||     The grep code 2 for errors is not used.
|| 
||     If "-f" or "-g" are specified, then 0 is returned if at least one file
||     is found. If no files are found, then 1 is returned.
|| 
|| DEBUGGING ACK PROBLEMS
||     If ack gives you output you're not expecting, start with a few simple
||     steps.
|| 
||   Try it with --noenv
||     Your environment variables and .ackrc may be doing things you're not
||     expecting, or forgotten you specified. Use --noenv to ignore your
||     environment and .ackrc.
|| 
||   Use -f to see what files have been selected for searching
||     Ack's -f was originally added as a debugging tool. If ack is not finding
||     matches you think it should find, run ack -f to see what files have been
||     selected. You can also add the "--show-types" options to show the type
||     of each file selected.
|| 
||   Use --dump
||     This lists the ackrc files that are loaded and the options loaded from
||     them. You may be loading an .ackrc file that you didn't know you were
||     loading.
|| 
|| ACKRC LOCATION SEMANTICS
||     Ack can load its configuration from many sources. The following list
||     specifies the sources Ack looks for configuration files; each one that
||     is found is loaded in the order specified here, and each one overrides
||     options set in any of the sources preceding it. (For example, if I set
||     --sort-files in my user ackrc, and --nosort-files on the command line,
||     the command line takes precedence)
|| 
||     *   Defaults are loaded from App::Ack::ConfigDefaults. This can be
||         omitted using "--ignore-ack-defaults".
|| 
||     *   Global ackrc
|| 
||         Options are then loaded from the global ackrc. This is located at
||         "/etc/ackrc" on Unix-like systems.
|| 
||         Under Windows XP and earlier, the global ackrc is at "C:\Documents
||         and Settings\All Users\Application Data\ackrc"
|| 
||         Under Windows Vista/7, the global ackrc is at "C:\ProgramData\ackrc"
|| 
||         The "--noenv" option prevents all ackrc files from being loaded.
|| 
||     *   User ackrc
|| 
||         Options are then loaded from the user's ackrc. This is located at
||         "$HOME/.ackrc" on Unix-like systems.
|| 
||         Under Windows XP and earlier, the user's ackrc is at "C:\Documents
||         and Settings\$USER\Application Data\ackrc".
|| 
||         Under Windows Vista/7, the user's ackrc is at
||         "C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\ackrc".
|| 
||         If you want to load a different user-level ackrc, it may be
||         specified with the $ACKRC environment variable.
|| 
||         The "--noenv" option prevents all ackrc files from being loaded.
|| 
||     *   Project ackrc
|| 
||         Options are then loaded from the project ackrc. The project ackrc is
||         the first ackrc file with the name ".ackrc" or "_ackrc", first
||         searching in the current directory, then the parent directory, then
||         the grandparent directory, etc. This can be omitted using "--noenv".
|| 
||     *   --ackrc
|| 
||         The "--ackrc" option may be included on the command line to specify
||         an ackrc file that can override all others. It is consulted even if
||         "--noenv" is present.
|| 
||     *   Command line
|| 
||         Options are then loaded from the command line.

|| 
|| FAQ
||     This is the Frequently Asked Questions list for ack.
|| 
||   Can I stop using grep now?
||     Many people find ack to be better than grep as an everyday tool 99% of
||     the time, but don't throw grep away, because there are times you'll
||     still need it. For example, you might be looking through huge log files
||     and not using regular expressions. In that case, grep will probably
||     perform better.
|| 
||   Why isn't ack finding a match in (some file)?
||     First, take a look and see if ack is even looking at the file. ack is
||     intelligent in what files it will search and which ones it won't, but
||     sometimes that can be surprising.
|| 
||     Use the "-f" switch, with no regex, to see a list of files that ack will
||     search for you. If your file doesn't show up in the list of files that
||     "ack -f" shows, then ack never looks in it.
|| 
||   Wouldn't it be great if ack did search & replace?
||     No, ack will always be read-only. Perl has a perfectly good way to do
||     search & replace in files, using the "-i", "-p" and "-n" switches.
|| 
||     You can certainly use ack to select your files to update. For example,
||     to change all "foo" to "bar" in all PHP files, you can do this from the
||     Unix shell:
|| 
||         $ perl -i -p -e's/foo/bar/g' $(ack -f --php)
|| 
||   Can I make ack recognize .xyz files?
||     Yes! Please see "Defining your own types" in the ack manual.
|| 
||   Will you make ack recognize .xyz files by default?
||     We might, depending on how widely-used the file format is.
|| 
||     Submit an issue at in the GitHub issue queue at
||     <https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/issues>. Explain what the file
||     format is, where we can find out more about it, and what you have been
||     using in your .ackrc to support it.
|| 
||     Please do not bother creating a pull request. The code for filetypes is
||     trivial compared to the rest of the process we go through.
|| 
||   Why is it called ack if it's called ack-grep?
||     The name of the program is "ack". Some packagers have called it
||     "ack-grep" when creating packages because there's already a package out
||     there called "ack" that has nothing to do with this ack.
|| 
||     I suggest you make a symlink named ack that points to ack-grep because
||     one of the crucial benefits of ack is having a name that's so short and
||     simple to type.
|| 
||     To do that, run this with sudo or as root:
|| 
||        ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/bin/ack
|| 
||     Alternatively, you could use a shell alias:
|| 
||         # bash/zsh
||         alias ack=ack-grep
|| 
||         # csh
||         alias ack ack-grep
|| 
||   What does ack mean?
||     Nothing. I wanted a name that was easy to type and that you could
||     pronounce as a single syllable.
|| 
||   Can I do multi-line regexes?
||     No, ack does not support regexes that match multiple lines. Doing so
||     would require reading in the entire file at a time.
|| 
||     If you want to see lines near your match, use the "--A", "--B" and "--C"
||     switches for displaying context.
|| 
||   Why is ack telling me I have an invalid option when searching for "+foo"?
||     ack treats command line options beginning with "+" or "-" as options; if
||     you would like to search for these, you may prefix your search term with
||     "--" or use the "--match" option. (However, don't forget that "+" is a
||     regular expression metacharacter!)
|| 
||   Why does "ack '.{40000,}'" fail?  Isn't that a valid regex?
||     The Perl language limits the repetition quantifier to 32K. You can
||     search for ".{32767}" but not ".{32768}".
|| 
||   Ack does "X" and shouldn't, should it?
||     We try to remain as close to grep's behavior as possible, so when in
